# Graphics Programming Project

## Introduction
This project is an exploration of interactive graphics and sound synthesis, demonstrating the capabilities of JavaScript and the p5.js library. It offers a dynamic visual and auditory experience where user interactions trigger graphical changes and sound.

## Features
- Interactive grid that responds to user input.
- Customized graphics with variable color, stroke, and opacity.
- Sound synthesis based on user interactions, with different criteria for triggering unique sounds using the MonoSynth class.

## Technologies
- p5.js for drawing and interactions.
- p5.sound.min.js for sound synthesis and audio functions.

## Setup
To run this project locally:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the application.

## Usage
- Interact with the grid elements to activate/deactivate notes.
- Adjust the threshold slider to change the sensitivity of the interaction.
- Experience the visual transformation and sound emission as you interact with the grid.

## Development
The project's core functionality is divided into two main files:
- `sketch.js`: Manages the application logic, including video capture, image processing, and sound synthesis.
- `Grid.js`: Defines the grid structure and handles the state and rendering of individual notes.

## Extension
The project includes extensions such as customized graphics and conditional sound playback, showcasing the extensibility of the application.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a creative platform combining visual programming and music, ideal for learning and experimenting with the artistic potential of coding.
